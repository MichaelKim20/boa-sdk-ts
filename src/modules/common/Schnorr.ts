/*******************************************************************************

    Low level utilities to perform Schnorr signatures on Curve25519.

    Through this module, lowercase letters represent scalars and uppercase
    letters represent points. Multiplication of a scalar by a point,
    which is adding a point to itself multiple times, is represented with '*',
    e.g. `a * G`. Uppercase letters are point representations of scalars,
    that is, the scalar multiplied by the generator, e.g. `r == r * G`.
    `x` is the private key, `X` is the public key, and `H()` is the Blake2b
    512 bits hash reduced to a scalar in the field.

    Following the Schnorr BIP (see links), signatures are of the form
    `(R,s)` and satisfy `s * G = R + H(X || R || m) * X`.
    `r` is referred to as the nonce and is a cryptographically randomly
    generated number that should neither be reused nor leaked.

    Signature_Aggregation:
    Since Schnorr signatures use a linear equation, they can be simply
    combined with addition, enabling `O(1)` signature verification
    time and `O(1)` and `O(1)` signature size.
    Additionally, since the `c` factor does not depend on EC operation,
    we can do batch verification, enabling us to speed up verification
    when verifying large amount of data (e.g. a block).
